This is the repository for the first project which for me is a banking app.

User Stories To Get To MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

As a user, I can:

#register a new user account with the system (must be secured with a password)
#login with my existing credentials
#create at least one account
#deposit funds into an account (use doubles, not ints)
#withdraw funds from an account (no overdrafting!)
#view the balance of my account(s) (all balance displays must be in proper currency format)
